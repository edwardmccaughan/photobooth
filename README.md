# Photobooth

An electron based photobooth that responds to arduino based buttons and prints 

Disclaimer: it's a hacky work in progress so if you want to use it for your own photobooth, you're more than welcome, but keep your expectations low...


installation notes:

* to get the seply910 working on ubuntu, you probably need to add the `gutenprint` apt package
* i also needed to rename the cups backend name
